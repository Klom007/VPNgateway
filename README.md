**Configuring VPN Gateway**
A VPN gateway connection relies on multiple resources that are configured with specific settings. Most of the resources can be configured separately, although some resources must be configured in a certain order.

**Connectivity**
Because you can create multiple connection configurations using VPN Gateway, you need to determine which configuration best fits your needs. Point-to-Site, Site-to-Site, and coexisting ExpressRoute/Site-to-Site connections all have different instructions and configuration requirements. For connection diagrams and corresponding links to configuration steps, see VPN Gateway design.
